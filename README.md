### Chameleon

This project is designed to use a custom trained onnx model to detect objects within a window's process (OldSchool Runescape).

It will take screenshots of the game every 200ms, and parse the image for specific objects, returning the rect of the found image.

It will then click the object in the game.


#### Major list of to-dos:
- Learn how to train the ML model.
- Draw boxes over the found objects in the windows form.
