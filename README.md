### Chameleon

This project is a WPF application which attaches itself to a running process.

It will allow the user to record their actions (mouse/keyboard events) within this running process.
After recording the actions, you can play back the records in real time. 

Essentially this thing is a screen recorder for a medieval point and click game called Oldschool Runescape. 
It allows you to automate repetitive actions within the game.


#### Major list of to-dos:
- Learn how to train the ML model.
- Draw boxes over the found objects in the windows form.
- Allow recordings to look for specific objects
- Automate response to objects.
